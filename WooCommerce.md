# WooCommerce Integration Overview

ClassWallet has a service called Pay By ClassWallet. This service enables Vendors to seamlessly
integrate our closed loop payments platform into your shopping cart.

You can easily perform the integration using our APIs or you can simply install a simple
WordPress WooCommerce plugin.\
The Plugin can be found at:
https://github.com/ClassWalletTech/classwallet-wordpress-plugin/releases

Please validate the hash of the plugin to ensure it is genuine and has not been tampered with.
Hash validation ensures that you have received a valid file from ClassWallet.

We use a MD5 Hash algorithm and you can validate our Hash using this online tool ( or any
other tool you choose): https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5_checksum.html. The MD5
for the current plugin can be found on the plugin download page.

To install this plugin, you need to be running WordPress 6.0 or later and WooCommerce 9.0 or
later.
The plugin has been tested up to WordPress 6.8.1 and WooCommerce 9.8.5

ClassWallet users enter your store from the ClassWallet application and will be
authenticated. Once our users access your site, they will only be presented with the ClassWallet
payment option. Your normal users will not be presented with ClassWallet as a payment
method.

5. After installation, you will see the plugin in the list. But you will still need to configure Pay By ClassWallet and this is done inside of WooCommerce. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments -> ClassWallet

**Initial order status**\
Select the status you would like when a new order is created. By default, the plugin will use the custom “CW Processing” status.\
Choose the initial order status that best fits your workflow. “CW Processing” is a non standard WooCommerce order status, and therefore, will not trigger WooCommerce status email triggers. If you need your normal emails to trigger, you may want to choose an initial order status from
the available WooCommerce order statuses in the dropdown.

**Payment Complete Status**\
Set a custom status for completed ClassWallet orders, e.g. “ClassWallet Complete.” Leave
blank to use the default “Processing” status.

**Title**\
Title to be displayed on the checkout page.

**Description**\
Displayed along with title on checkout page.

**ClassWallet Vendor Id**\
Provided by ClassWallet during onboarding.

**Basic HTTP Auth Username**\

## Logging and Debugging
Many operations that the plugin makes leave a log entry trail for verification and validation +
general debugging. You can view these logs at:
`WooCommerce -> Status -> Logs`
### Sample log output

Enable Debugging mode, and attempt to replicate the error or behavior. Please provide the entire log dump for the day in question when contacting support if possible.

All transactions need to be approved. We will notify your plugin when the sale is either “Approved” or “Canceled.” You can look at orders and see their status under the WooCommerce orders area. You can only ship or deliver when the payment transaction is
complete.
